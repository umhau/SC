# SC
This is a tool for encrypting communication.  Most of the fundamentals have yet to be worked out, so it's thus far a collection of scripts doing various things.

## TODO
- Negotiate a list of functions, specifying their inputs and outputs and the structure of the code.
- encryption/decryption engine.  This should be a script that takes a [chunk? single byte?] of data and a corresponding data of random data, xor's it and returns the output.
